I have been part of WOCATI since 2008, when Prof. Dr. Namsoon Kang asked me to serve as the Web Administrator for the organization.
In this capacity I have been part of several major projects for WOCATI.

## WOCATI website evolution
WOCATI started out as raw HTML and iFrames before moving onto typo3 hosted by the [World Council of Churches](https:///oikoumene.org) before moving onto WordPress with a custom theme. Presently WOCATI's website is running on the static site generator Jekyll and is hosted on Github. Transitioning to Jekyll + Github allows for WOCATI's website to be fast and responsive for its global audience.

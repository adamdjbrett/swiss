	>>Religious Observances Notification and Policy

	>>SU religious observances notification and policy, found at  https://hendricks.syr.edu/spiritual-life/index.html, recognizes the diversity of faiths represented among the campus community and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holidays according to their tradition.  Under the policy, students are provided an opportunity to make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a religious observance provided they notify their instructors before the end of the second week of classes for regular session classes and by the submission deadline for flexibly formatted classes.

	>>For fall and spring semesters, an online notification process is available for students in **My Slice / StudentServices / Enrollment / MyReligiousObservances / Add a Notification.**  Instructors may access a list of their students who have submitted a notification in My Slice Faculty Center. [Enter course specific language as appropriate, about how and when academic requirements will be made up.]

What is your story?
As a Ph.D. candidate in religion, I understand the power and importance of stories. I want to help you find and tell your story. With over a decade of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) experience, I am well equipped to help you articulate your story. Whether you need assistance with course development, digital humanities, event planning, web development, or social media, I am happy to help.

## Online Course Development
I am available for consulting on course design, assignments, managing an online course, and integrating various online platforms into the classroom in meaningful ways that enhance the learning goals and outcome of the course.

### Learning Management Systems
Working in technology and communications, I have extensive experience with Blackboard and Moodle on the backend and front-end of these platforms. I understand their limitations and boundaries.
  - Blackboard
  - Moodle  

### New Media in the Classroom
Are you interested in integrating new media into the classroom? I can help you navigate the vast array to platforms and find what meets your needs and your student's needs. Whether that is one of the platforms listed below or something else, let me know.
  - Blogging
  - Slack, Discord
  - Social Media
  - Podcasting
  - Online Video   

## Web Development
Are you interested in a website for your digital humanities project, an educational website, a professional site, or even a personal site? I am here to help. My [CV](/cv/) contains an extensive list of projects and websites I have helped develop. I am committed to helping you find something that works well for your needs and fits within your budget. In today's media landscape it is critical for all academics and professionals to have ["A Domain of One's Own"](https://www.wired.com/insights/2012/07/a-domain-of-ones-own/). Using responsive web design principles your website will look fantastic on all devices.

## Social Media
Social media is a vast landscape filled with every changing platforms. Not every platform works for every person or project. I would like to work with you to craft intentional social media content that reflects who you are and plays to the strengths of the social media platform that you wish to use.

## Call for Papers
The Religion Graduate Organization and the [Department of Religion at Syracuse University](http://religion.syr.edu/) announce [the 2018 Graduate Student Conference **Flourish and Decay: Exploring Religion in Process on Friday, April 13<sup>th</sup>, 2018.**](/)
[![Flourish and Decay Decorative Header](/assets/img/tn/flourish-and-decay-header-main-min_tn.jpg)](/assets/img/misc/flourish-and-decay-header-main-min.jpg)

_**Flour·ish**: [‘flǝriSH] (n., v.) growth and development in a good environment; a gesture or to gesture in such a way that attracts attention._

_**De·cay**: [dǝ͘‘kā] ‘(n., v.) to rot organically or the process of decomposition; to deteriorate; to fall into a state of disrepair. Rotten matter. A gradual decline of quality._

This conference proposes the terms “flourish” and “decay” as entry points through which to further understand how religion emerges and envelops within past, present, and future worlds.

Both flourish and decay can operate as either overarching metaphors of change, transformation, and fluctuation or as literal descriptions of cycles of growth, consumption, and loss. We embrace the capaciousness of these terms and encourage graduate students to think innovatively through them as an opportunity to explore religion _in_ process. We welcome diversity in topics, theoretical approaches, and methodologies from all academic fields and disciplines across a broad range of histories, geographies, and religious traditions.
